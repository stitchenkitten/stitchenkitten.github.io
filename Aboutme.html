<h1> Meet the Designer </h1>
<p>I decided to move to New York City 2 years ago and I love every minute of it.  Meeting new people expanding my horizons the usual small town girl in a big city romance story. Of course I also adopted my first cat.</p>

<p>I have always enjoyed the company of animals from living with them to volunteering at animal shelters. When I went to school for Apparel Merchandising and Design I asked my Professor if I could make a line of pet clothes.  I was given a straight up NO and so I squandered the idea.</p>

  <p>When it was way to cold to go out and experience the NYC lifestyle, I picked up my knitting needles and just made something for my cat.  Just a simple knitted collar.  However, I just loved how she looked in it and I posted a picture and I was given great feedback.  I thought what else can I do?  So I made a Bow Tie, and then a Tie.  Some people at work saw it and also wanted one, so I thought  I can make something out of this. </p>

 <p>I finally got to utilize the skills I learned from college to something I  fee really passionate about. I love pulling my ideas from the city, comics, movies, and books. I'm just your everyday knitting crazy cat lady.</p>
